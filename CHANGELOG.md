# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).
This project was forked from Electrum v2.7.1 thus the first release is
labeled as 2.7.1. Subsequent releases will follow
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
### Security
  * Stop allowing CORS for the JSON-RPC server (applies to lbryum daemon). See [electrum/issues/3374](https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/3374)
  *

### Fixed
  * Use lock when performing WalletStorage.write()
  * Fixed `sendclaimtoaddress` for signed content claims
  * Fixed `https://github.com/lbryio/lbryum/issues/188`
  * Fixed main account not being created by `restore`
  * Fixed claim result from `getcertificatesforsigning` with only the `is_mine` field being returned for claims that aren't yet returned by `getclaimsbyids`. This caused bugs when making claims with channels that were not yet confirmed (https://github.com/lbryio/lbry/issues/1037).

### Deprecated
  *
  *

### Changed
  * Improved speed of `getunusedaddress`
  * Moved storage.write call in `getunusedaddress` to `Deterministic_Wallet`
  * By default use the least used change address rather than generating new ones for claims.
  * Only consider addresses with less than 100 utxos for re-use.
  * Set the blockchain to use in lbryschema when it is set in lbryum
  * Use separate headers files for different chains, the default `blockchain_headers` for lbrycrd_main is unchanged. Regtest headers are saved to `regtest_headers`, and testnet to `testnet_headers`.
  * Reworked `payto`, `paytoandsend`, `paytomany`, `paytomanyandsend` into single `payto` command
  * Tip information is now always returned in `claimhistory` command
  * Information about abandoned claim/update/support is now returned in `claimhistory` command
  * Changed `offline_parse_and_validate_claim_result` and `parse_and_validate_claim_result` to include a permanent URL to claim and/or certificate.

  * Added OS keyring support for storing the wallet encryption password
  * Added codecov.io reporting and updated README.rst with coverage badge.
  * Added `value` and `claim_address` fields to response from `claim`, `update`, and `claimcertificate`
  * Added `no_password` parameter to `restore` command
  * Added `--chain` parameter to command line to specify `lbrycrd_regtest` or `lbrycrd_testnet` instead of default `lbrycrd_main`
  * `get_max_spendable_amount_for_claim` to get the max amount that can be used to update a claim

### Removed
